The aim of this framework is to demonstrate the confidence that could be achieved by trying out different
scenarios for
different APIs but not to automate all the scenarios like invalid ones.

Test Classes are created based on the functionality.
We have used Rest Assured & JUnit to test the APIs.


We have created an AppConfig file,where we have defined the baseURL.
Since the host name may vary for environment to environment,
this will be single point of
change required (or could be set using system env. variable)

Each class does it's own setup in the test itself.

The TestData files are kept separately under resources.
